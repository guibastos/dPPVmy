  		<h1>Introduction</h1>
  		<p>I'm a father of 2 (+1dog), soccer player, pianist and snowboarder. </p>
  		<br>
  		<p>My family, my friends and having fun are the most important thing to me.</p>

  		<h1>Where I'm from</h1>
		<p>I am originally from Brazil. I grew up in a city in the south of Brazil called Curitiba. When you think of Brazil, you think of warm weather, beaches and happy people drinking beer. Well, Curitiba is not exactly that. It is a nice, well organized city, but cold and super humid. My uncle had a Siberian Husky who slept outside and could not survive Curitiba’s weather. She died in a cold winter night.  A breed that can thrive on extreme temperatures of Alaska and Northern Europe, could not survive Curitiba’s cold and humid winter nights.</p>

  		<h1>More About Me</h1>
  			<h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
			<p>Well, I guess my description pretty much sums it all. I do play soccer. A lot. I play 3 times a week only because I used to play 4-5 times and I was getting hurt way too many times. I did cut down to 3 times a week because of that. I also play the piano. I did learn piano growing up, but in the last 10 years, I’ve been back to studying with a professional pianist on a weekly basis. Last, when winter time comes, I’m ready to hit the slopes with my board. Can’t wait for next season to start.</p>

  			<h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
			<p>For some reason, I have a real hard time putting together these two words in the same sentence: dream and job. I started a company a few years back, and I do not plan to go back to the traditional “workforce” ever again.</p>

  			<h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
			<p>As a father of a 5-year-old boy, it is my duty and obligation to introduce him to heavy metal. For this reason, I have been spending some quality time with my son in my car while I drive him to and from pre-school, listening to Iron Maiden, Metallica, AC/DC and eventually, Black Sabbath. He does enjoy that. My son has already memorize several lyrics including “Running Free”, “Iron Maiden” and “Flight of Icarus”. His favorite song, though, is “Fear of the Dark”.</p>
